        "- In Python, a **function** is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task and can be called independently using its name, like `print()` or a user-defined function. A **method**, on the other hand, is a function that is associated with an object and is called using the dot (`.`) notation. Methods operate on the data within the object they belong to. For example, `len(\"hello\")` is a function, while `\"hello\".upper()` is a method of the string object. So, the key difference is that methods are functions **bound to objects**, while regular functions are not."
